      To say a widget has <em class="firstterm">focus</em> means that
      keyboard input is currently directed to that widget.
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
          By <em class="firstterm">focus traversal</em>, we mean the
          sequence of widgets that will be visited as the user
          moves from widget to widget with the
          <span class="keysym">tab</span> key.  See below for the rules for
          this sequence.
        </p></li><li><p>
          You can traverse backwards using
          <span class="keysym">shift-tab</span>.
        </p></li><li><p>
          The <code class="code">Entry</code> and <code class="code">Text</code>
          widgets are intended to accept keyboard input, and if
          an entry or text widget currently has the focus, any
          characters you type into it will be added to its text.
          The usual editing characters such as ← and
          → will have their usual effects.
        </p></li><li><p>
          Because <code class="code">Text</code> widgets can contain tab
          characters, you must use the special key sequence
          <span class="keysym">control-tab</span> to move the focus past a
          text widget.
        </p></li><li><p>
          Most of the other types of widgets will normally be
          visited by focus traversal, and when they have focus:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li><p>
              <code class="code">Button</code> widgets can be
              “pressed” by pressing the spacebar.
            </p></li><li><p>
              <code class="code">Checkbutton</code> widgets can be toggled
              between set and cleared states using the spacebar.
            </p></li><li><p>
              In <code class="code">Listbox</code> widgets, the ↑ and
              ↓ keys scroll up or down one line; the
              <span class="keysym">PageUp</span> and
              <span class="keysym">PageDown</span> keys scroll by pages; and
              the spacebar selects the current line, or
              de-selects it if it was already selected.
            </p></li><li><p>
              You can set a <code class="code">Radiobutton</code> widget by
              pressing the spacebar.
            </p></li><li><p>
              Horizontal <code class="code">Scale</code> widgets respond to
              the ← and → keys, and vertical ones
              respond to ↑ and ↓.
            </p></li><li><p>
              In a <code class="code">Scrollbar</code> widget, the
              <span class="keysym">PageUp</span> and
              <span class="keysym">PageDown</span> keys move the scrollbar
              by pageloads.  The ↑ and ↓ keys will
              move vertical scrollbars by units, and the ←
              and → keys will move horizontal scrollbars
              by units.
            </p></li></ul></div></li><li><p>
          Many widgets are provided with an outline called the
          <em class="firstterm">focus highlight</em> that shows the
          user which widget has the highlight.  This is normally
          a thin black frame located just outside the widget's
          border (if any).  For widgets that don't normally have
          a focus highlight (specifically, frames, labels, and
          menus), you can set the <code class="code">highlightthickness</code> option to a nonzero value to make the focus highlight
          visible.
        </p></li><li><p>
          You can also change the color of the focus highlight
          using the <code class="code">highlightcolor</code> option.
        </p></li><li><p>
          Widgets of class <code class="code">Frame</code>, <code class="code">Label</code>, and <code class="code">Menu</code> are not
          normally visited by the focus.  However, you can set
          their <code class="code">takefocus</code> options to <code class="code">1</code> to get them included in focus traversal.
          You can also take any widget out of focus traversal by
          setting its <code class="code">takefocus</code> option to <code class="code">0</code>.
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
      The order in which the <span class="keysym">tab</span> key traverses
      the widgets is:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
          For widgets that are children of the same parent, focus
          goes in the same order the widgets were created.
        </p></li><li><p>
          For parent widgets that contain other widgets (such as
          frames), focus visits the parent widget first (unless
          its <code class="code">takefocus</code> option is <code class="code">0</code>), then it visits the child widgets, recursively, in
          the order they were created.
        </p></li></ul></div><p>
      To sum up: to set up the focus traversal order of your
      widgets, create them in that order.  Remove widgets from
      the traversal order by setting their <code class="code">takefocus</code> options to 0, and for those whose default <code class="code">takefocus</code> option is <code class="code">0</code>, set it to
      <code class="code">1</code> if you want to add them to the order.
    </p><p>
      The above describes the default functioning of input focus
      in <span class="application">Tkinter</span>.  There is another, completely different way to
      handle it—let the focus go wherever the mouse goes.
      Under <a href="universal.html" title="26. Universal widget methods">Section 26, “Universal widget methods”</a>, refer to the <code class="code">.tk_focusFollowsMouse()</code> method.
    </p><p>
      You can also add, change or delete the way any key on the
      keyboard functions inside any widget by using event
      bindings.  See <a href="events.html" title="54. Events: responding to stimuli">Section 54, “Events”</a> for the details.
